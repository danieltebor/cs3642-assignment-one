## Automatic Air Conditioning Agent
The goal for assignment one is to create a simple AI model. The model idea is to create an air conditioning agent. The agent will be given the desired temperatures of everyone living at a house. Every hour, the model will assess who is currently home and adjust the temperature to the average of the current people who are home.
